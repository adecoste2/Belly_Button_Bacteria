# Belly_Button_Bacteria

## Purpose
Improbable Beef performed a study on test subjects based on the biodiversity of each subject's belly button as it has been found that specific bacteria found in one's belly button can be added to plant-based meat to create a realistic meat flavor. These results were put into a json file for analysis. These resuts were then read into JavaScript code and HTML code to create an interactive webpage for test subjects to look up their data.
